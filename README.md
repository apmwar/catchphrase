# catchphrase
Catchphrase is a grid game based off of 2048 made purely out of Turbo C++ (including the graphics libraries) as a Highschool coding Project.


# How To Play

The game is pretty straightforward. 

___OBJECTIVE_: You are given a 4x4 grid and you need to merge tiles until the missing letters in the given phrase are filled up.__

An _A_ tile can be merged with another _A_ tile to get a _B_ tile. Similarly, a _B_ tile merges with another _B_ tile to get a _C_ tile and so on.
