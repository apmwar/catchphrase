# catchphrase
Catchphrase is a grid game based off of 2048 made purely out of Turbo C++ (including the graphics libraries) as a Highschool coding Project.


# How To Play

The game is pretty straightforward. You are given a grid and you need to merge tiles until the blanks in the phrase are completed. An A tile can be merged with another A tile to get a B tile. Similarly, a B tile merges with another B tile to get a C tile and so on.
