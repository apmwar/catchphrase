Catch Phrase is a simple grid game that’s entertaining and super simple to play. The player is given an incomplete phrase, and during the course of the game, he has to fill up the blanks. The game is played out on a 4x4 grid consisting of 16 tiles. The way this game works is similar to the game it originated from, 2048, except you replace the 2’s with A’s, and all consecutive powers of 2 (4, 8, 16 etc.) with the next alphabet. So in the place of 2 we use A, in the place of 4 we use B, C for 8, D for 16 and so on. The objective of the game is to move the tiles in such a way that you obtain all the required letters that are missing from the given phrase(s) displayed on the screen. You initially start off with two A’s present on the grid in two random positions. You can enable the directional control of the tiles by typing in the letters ‘W’ for up, ‘S’ for down, ‘A’ for left and ‘D’ for right. If two equal letters come in contact when you move the grid up, down, left or right, they combine to form the next letter of the alphabet. So two A’s would form one ‘B’ tile, two B’s form a ‘C’ tile and so on. The game ends if you are successful in collecting all the required letters or if all the tiles are occupied and no two letters on the board are identical.
